### Background information

Norlife gathers data about a user and visualizes their habits in order to more accurately and fairly calculate their life insurance premiums. Norlife is also able to encourage users to live a healthier lifestyle and to remove the barriers that people feel prevent them from getting life insurance.

### The app
We created an iOS app that utilizes a MongoDB database hosted on a DigitalOcean instance for back-end data processing. We also use several APIs (like Clarifai, Nordea, and Microsoft Cognitive Services) to gather data on a user's habits. The app provides an interface that shows how the user is scoring in terms of good habits, and gives feedback on the best and worst actions on a daily and monthly basis. It also offers a forecast on how the monthly premium can be affected by the current habits.
